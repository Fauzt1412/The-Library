## 🎯 New Features Added

### 1. **Reading Links Section**

{book.readingLinks && Array.isArray(book.readingLinks) && book.readingLinks.length > 0 && (
  <div className="mb-4">
    <h5>Reading Links</h5>
    {book.readingLinks.map((link, index) => (
      <a href={link.url} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        {link.name}
      </a>
    ))}
  </div>
)}
```

### 2. **Enhanced Share Functionality**
```javascript
// Uses native share API with clipboard fallback
onClick={() => {
  if (navigator.share) {
    navigator.share({
      title: book.title,
      text: `Check out "${book.title}" by ${book.author}`,
      url: window.location.href
    });
  } else {
    navigator.clipboard.writeText(window.location.href);
    alert('Link copied to clipboard!');
  }
}}
```

### 3. **Publisher Information Display**
```javascript
// Shows who published the book
{book.publishedBy && (
  <small className="text-muted">
    Published by: {book.publishedBy.username || book.publishedBy.email}
  </small>
)}
```

### 4. **Comprehensive Logging**
```javascript
// Debug logging for troubleshooting
console.log('📚 Starting to fetch book details for ID:', id);
console.log('📚 Book detail response:', {...});
console.log('📚 Setting book data:', {...});
```

## 🚀 Testing Instructions

### Step 1: Test the API
```bash
# Run the book detail test script
node test-book-detail.js
```

This will:
- ✅ Check if books exist in the database
- ✅ Test book detail API with valid ID
- ✅ Test error handling with invalid ID
- ✅ Show the response structure

### Step 2: Test the Frontend

1. **Start the frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

2. **Navigate to a book detail page**:
   - Go to `/books` page
   - Click on any book's "View Details" button
   - Or directly visit `/books/{book-id}`

3. **Check browser console** for debug messages:
   ```
   📚 Starting to fetch book details for ID: 67...
   📚 Book detail response: {status: 200, dataType: "object", ...}
   📚 Setting book data: {id: "67...", title: "...", author: "..."}
   ```

5. **Database**: Verify books exist in the database

### Common Issues:
