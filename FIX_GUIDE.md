# üîß FIXED: "Failed to load resource: net::ERR_FAILED"

## ‚úÖ What I Fixed

### 1. Missing Static Files
- **Created** `frontend/public/favicon.ico` - Browser was looking for this
- **Created** `frontend/public/manifest.json` - Required for PWA functionality  
- **Removed** broken reference to `logo192.png` from HTML

### 2. Created Helper Scripts
- **`start-dev.bat`** - Windows script to start both servers
- **`start-dev.sh`** - Linux/Mac script to start both servers
- **`health-check.js`** - Script to test if everything is working
- **`TROUBLESHOOTING_GUIDE.md`** - Comprehensive debugging guide

## üöÄ How to Start Your Application

### Option 1: Use the Helper Scripts

**Windows:**
```bash
# Double-click start-dev.bat or run:
start-dev.bat
```

**Linux/Mac:**
```bash
# Make executable and run:
chmod +x start-dev.sh
./start-dev.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Start

**Terminal 1 - Backend:**
```bash
cd Server
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Terminal 2 - Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

## üîç Test if Everything Works

### Quick Test
```bash
# Install axios if not already installed
npm install axios

# Run health check
node health-check.js
```

### Manual Test
1. **Backend Health**: Visit `http://localhost:1412/health`
2. **API Health**: Visit `http://localhost:1412/API/health`
3. **Frontend**: Visit `http://localhost:3000`

## üêõ If You Still Get Errors

### Most Common Issues:

1. **MongoDB not running**
   ```bash
   # Windows: Start MongoDB service
   net start MongoDB
   
   # Linux: 
   sudo systemctl start mongod
   
   # Mac:
   brew services start mongodb/brew/mongodb-community
   ```

2. **Port 1412 already in use**
   ```bash
   # Find what's using the port
   netstat -ano | findstr :1412
   
   # Kill the process or change port in Server/.env
   ```

3. **Wrong environment variables**
   ```bash
   # Check Server/.env file exists and has:
   DATABASE_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/Storage_database_SYS
   PORT=1412
   
   # Check frontend/.env.local has:
   REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:1412
   ```

4. **Dependencies not installed**
   ```bash
   # Backend
   cd Server && npm install
   
   # Frontend  
   cd frontend && npm install
   ```

## ‚ú® Success Indicators

When everything is working, you should see:

### Backend Console:
```
üöÄ Starting server on port 1412
‚úÖ MongoDB connected
üöÄ Server is running on http://localhost:1412
```

### Frontend Console:
```
webpack compiled successfully
Local:            http://localhost:3000
```

### Browser:
- No red errors in Developer Tools Console
- Application loads without "Failed to load resource" errors
- Data displays properly

## üìû Need More Help?

1. **Check the logs** in both terminal windows for error messages
2. **Read** `TROUBLESHOOTING_GUIDE.md` for detailed debugging steps
3. **Run** `node health-check.js` to diagnose issues
4. **Verify** all files exist:
   - `frontend/public/favicon.ico` ‚úÖ
   - `frontend/public/manifest.json` ‚úÖ
   - `Server/.env` (should exist)
   - `frontend/.env.local` (should exist)

## üéØ What Was Causing the Error

The "Failed to load resource: net::ERR_FAILED" error was caused by:

1. **Missing favicon.ico** - Browser automatically requests this file
2. **Missing manifest.json** - Referenced in HTML but didn't exist
3. **Missing logo192.png** - Referenced in HTML but didn't exist
4. **Potentially**: Backend server not running or connection issues

All static file issues are now fixed! If you still get the error, it's likely a backend connectivity issue that can be resolved by following the troubleshooting guide.
