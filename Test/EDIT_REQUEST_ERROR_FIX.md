## 🔍 How to Debug the Issue

### Step 1: Check Browser Console

1. Open browser Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Try submitting an edit request
4. Look for detailed logs starting with:
   - `📝 Starting edit request submission...`
   - `📤 Submitting edit request data:`
   - `✅ Edit request submitted successfully:` (success)
   - `❌ Error submitting edit request:` (error)

### Step 2: Check Server Console

1. Look at your server terminal/console
2. When you submit an edit request, you should see:
   - `📝 Edit Request Submission Started`
   - `✅ Basic validation passed`
   - `🔍 Looking up content...`
   - `✅ Content found: [title]`
   - `🔐 Checking ownership...`
   - `✅ User owns this content`
   - `📝 Creating edit request...`
   - `✅ Edit request saved with ID: [id]`

### Step 3: Common Issues and Solutions

#### 🔐 **Authentication Issues**
**Symptoms:** "User ID is required" or "Invalid user"
**Solutions:**
- Ensure you're logged in
- Check `localStorage.getItem('user')` in browser console
- Refresh the page and try again

#### 📝 **Validation Issues**
**Symptoms:** "Content type is required", "Content ID is required", etc.
**Solutions:**
- Check that all form fields are filled
- Ensure content type is "book" or "game"
- Verify content ID is valid

#### 🗄️ **Database Issues**
**Symptoms:** "Content not found", "You can only edit your own content"
**Solutions:**
- Ensure the content exists in your database
- Verify you're the owner of the content
- Check if there's already a pending edit request

#### 🔧 **Server Issues**
**Symptoms:** "Server error", "Error submitting edit request"
**Solutions:**
- Check server is running (`cd Server && node server.js`)
- Ensure MongoDB is running and connected
- Check server logs for specific error details
